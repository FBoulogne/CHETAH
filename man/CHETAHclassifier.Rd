CHETAHclassifier(input, ref_cells = NULL, ref_types = NULL,
  ref_profiles = NULL, thresh = 0.1, gs_method = "fc",
  cor_method = "spearman", clust_method = "average",
  clust_dist = bioDist::spearman.dist, n_genes = 200,
  pc_thresh = 0.2, p_thresh = 0.05, fc_thresh = 1.5,

}
\arguments{
\item{input}{\strong{required}: an expression matrix (matrix, data.frame or Matrix) of the cells of interest, with cells in the columns and genes in the rows}

\item{ref_cells}{\strong{required}: either \cr (1) a list of expression matrices, with one matrix for each reference cell type. IMPORTANT:
\emph{the list has to be named!} (with the corresponding cell types) \cr
(2) one expression matrix: in this case provide the cell type label in the \code{ref_type} variable.}

\item{ref_types}{\strong{required}: when ref_cells is one matrix, ref_types must be a vector of the cell types. The names must correspond to the column names of \code{ref_cells}, in the same order!.}

\item{ref_profiles}{\emph{optional} In case of bulk-RNA seq or micro-arrays, an expression matrix with one (average) reference expression profile per cell type.}

\item{thresh}{the initial confidence threshold (can be changed later by \code{\link{Classify}})}

\item{gs_method}{method for gene selection. In every node of the tree: \cr
"fc" = quick method: either a fixed amount (\code{n_genes}) of genes is selected with the highest fold-change (default), \cr
or genes are selected that have a fold-change higher than \code{fc_thresh} (the latter is used when \code{fix_ngenes = FALSE}) . \cr
"wilcox": genes are selected based on fold-change (\code{fc_thresh}), percentage of expression (\code{pc_thresh}) and p-values (\code{p_thresh}), p-values are found by the wilcox test}

\item{cor_method}{the correlation measure: one of: "spearman" (default), "kendall", "pearson", "cosine"}

\item{clust_method}{the method used for clustering the reference profiles
one of the methods from \code{\link[stats]{hclust}}}

\item{clust_dist}{a distance measure, default: \code{\link[bioDist]{spearman.dist}}}

\item{n_genes}{The amount of genes used in every step. Only used if \code{fix_ngenes = TRUE}}

\item{pc_thresh}{when: \emph{gs_method = "wilcox"}, only genes are selected for which more than a \code{pc_tresh} fraction of a reference group of cells express that gene}

\item{p_thresh}{when: \emph{gs_method = "wilcox" }, only genes are selected that have a p-value < \code{p_thresh}}

\item{fc_thresh}{when: \emph{gs_method = "wilcox" or gs_method = "fc" AND fix_ngenes = FALSE}, only genes are selected that have a log2 fld-change > \code{fc_thresh} between two reference groups. \cr
\strong{if this mode is selected, the reference must be in the log2 space}.}

\item{subsample}{to prevent reference types with a lot of cells to influence the gene selection, subsample types with more that \code{subsample} cells}

\item{fix_ngenes}{when: \emph{gs_method = "fc"} use a fixed amount of genes for all correlations. when: \emph{gs_method = "wilcox"} use a maximum of genes per step.
When \code{fix_ngenes = FALSE & gs_methode = "fc"} \code{fc_thresh} is used to define the fold-change cut-off for gene selection.}

\item{plot.tree}{Plot the classification tree.}

\item{only_pos}{\emph{not recommended}: only use genes for a reference type that are higher expressed in that type, than the others in that node.}

\item{print_steps}{whether the number of genes (postive and negative) per step per ref_cell_type should be printed}
}
\value{
The chetah object:
A list containing the following objects:
NOTE: all objects that are lists themselfs contain one object per node in the classification tree
\itemize{
  \item \strong{classification} a named vector: the classified types with the corresponding names of the input cells
  \item \strong{prof_scores} A list with the profile scores
  \item \strong{conf_scores} A list with the confidence scores
  \item \strong{nodetypes} A list with the cell types under each node
  \item \strong{correlations} A list with the correlations of the input cells to the reference profiles
  \item \strong{tree} the hclust object of the classification tree
  \item \strong{nodecoor} the coordinates of the nodes of the classification tree
  \item \strong{genes} A list per node, containing a list per reference type with the genes used for the profile scores of that type
  \item \strong{parameters} The parameters used
}
}
\description{
CHETAH will hierarchically cluster the reference data
to produce a classification tree (ct). In each node of the ct, CHETAH will
divide the classification to the two branches based on gene selections, correlations and calculation of profile and confidence scores. \cr
Some input cells will reach the leaf nodes of the ct (the pre-defined cell types), these classifications are called \strong{final types} \cr
For other cells, assignment will stop in a node, if no enough evidence is available to assign that cell to one of the branches of that node. These classifcations are called \strong{intermediate types}.  \cr
\emph{NOTE: We recommend to use the default parameters, as these usually give the best results.}
